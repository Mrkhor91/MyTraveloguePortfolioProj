The valley is surrounded by majestic snow-capped peaks, offering a serene and picturesque landscape that captivates visitors with its tranquil charm and natural splendor. <br> I first visited it back in 2015 with my group. To reach this place we had to drive for 9 hours from Islamabad. The road from Bahrian to Kalam was in bad shape earlier but now its being recarpeted so traveling is very much eased up. From Kalam we traveled towards North-East to reach Ushu which is just a beautiful dense forest. From there, we traveled for one hour further to reach magnificient Mahodand lake, which is quite special as it looks more like a flowing stream than a lake.</p>

This pristine alpine lake, surrounded by majestic snow-capped peaks, offers a stunning contrast with its crystal-clear waters reflecting the sky and mountains. <br> I went on this trip with four bestfriends. Initially we drove all the way to Kel and then took a jeep ride to Shounter. And from there it was a challenging 7-8 hour hike, making it a rewarding destination for avid trekkers. The untouched and tranquil beauty of Chitta Khatta Lake, makes it a must-visit for those seeking solitude and natural splendor in the heart of Kashmir. <br>

                      <p class="card-text">This picture was taken somewhere between Shounter and Chitta Khatta. The terrein was just mind blowingly beautiful and dangerous at the same time. There are 2-3 glaciers which should  be crossed in order to reach this place. This picture was taken after climbing the glacier. <br> It still goes down as one of best hikes i have ever done in all my life. I went to this hike alongwith 4 of my best friends. We embarked on this hiking trip without being prepared and one of our friends left us mid-way as hike started getting challenging. The trek kept on getting more and more challenging and cherry on the top it started to rain midway through the journey. The trek got slippery and one of our friend tripped twice but luckily got saved by a rock at the edge. Despite all the hardships the vistas were worth it. Undoubtedly it is one of best treks in Pakistan. </p>

I had been to this lake before in summers but i did not like it back then. But in winters this breathtaking lake transforms into a frozen wonderland. The serene, ice-covered surface of the lake mirrors the surrounding snow-clad peaks, creating a mesmerizing and tranquil landscape and it is also a good place for ice-skating as well. Reaching the top i felt captivated by the crystal-clear reflections and the stark, pristine beauty that surrounds it. <br> We embarked on a journey to this lake in November, little did we know that all the hotels in Naran close down in Early November and road to the Naran gets frosty at night. We survived falling off the road couple of times but nonetheless it was a memorable trip.  </p>

Surrounded by towering, rugged mountains partially cloaked in snow, the lake's crystal-clear waters reflect the stunning landscape, creating a serene and picturesque scene. The vibrant colors of the surrounding meadows and the occasional patches of wildflowers add to the enchanting charm of this hidden gem. <br> I visited this lake back in 2019 with two of my very close friends. At first we tried to use Babusar route unaware of the fact that it was still covered with snow. Then we had to spend a night in Kaghan before proceeding to Astore via KKH. It takes 17 hrs to travel to Astore from Abbotabad and from Astore it takes 5-6 hours on jeep to reach this piece of Heaven. I have been to almost all the major tourist destinations in Pakistan but there is nothing more greener and peaceful as this small town. </p>

It was named Katora meaning "bowl"after the lakes resemblance to a bowl shape. We started our journey from Islamabad at night and reached Thal in the morning, from where we took a jeep to Taki Banda. After reaching Taki Banda, we were all tired but we did not want to waste our time there so we started trek to Jahaz Banda straigh away. It was a 2-3 hour trek to Jahaz Banda which is a beautiful meadow. We camped the night there and started our journey to Katora lake in the morning, which was much easier then previous hike. We spent the day there and then moved back to Islamabad in the night.</p>

There are only two protruding rock structures in the world which give such scenic view of the valley, one is in Norway with the name of Trolltunga and other is in Skardu. One more unique thing about this place is that there is no proper trek leading to this point, it is totally out in the wild without any navigational points <br> Hussainabad, situated just after Skardu en route to Khaplu, serves as the starting point for this exhilarating trek. The journey commences with a scenic drive up a winding road on the upper side of the town, followed by an hour-long hike through lush greenery. Subsequently, you’ll encounter a steeper trail, taking around 2 hours to conquer if you are physically fit. As you continue, the path gradually levels out, leading you to a unique and extensive sloping stone. </p>
